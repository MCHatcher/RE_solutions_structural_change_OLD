# Rational_expectations_solutions_under_structural_change
This project sets out a recursive solution method for linear rational expectations models subject to anticipated structural changes, such as parameter shifts and policy reforms, that are announced in advance. The theoretical results in the paper are complemented by examples and codes which make the method easier to understand and use.
